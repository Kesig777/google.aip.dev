**TL;DR:** AIPs are lots of documents on how Google does APIs.

## Overview

AIP stands for **API Improvement Proposal**, which is a design document
providing high-level, concise documentation for API development. The goal is
for these documents to serve as the source of truth for API-related
documentation at Google and the way API teams discuss and come to consensus on
API guidance. The program is named and styled after Python's enhancement
proposals (PEPs) which have seemed to work pretty well over the years.

### Specific areas inside Google

While much of the API-related guidance is general and spans across all the
different products at Google, we've found that some teams working in different
areas may have different customs, styles, or guidance. To accommodate these
historical differences, we've provided separate blocks of numbers for those
areas where they might override or extend the more general guidance.

## Getting started

### New to AIPs?

If you're **new to AIPs**, check out the [Frequently Asked Questions][] which
answer some common questions about how AIPs work and what you need to know.

### Want to use this in your company?

If you like what you see and **want to adopt the general AIPs for your
organization**, check out our guide on [Adopting AIPs in your company][]. This
guide walks you through how to start using AIPs and write your own guidance
specific to your organization.

### Have an idea for an AIP?

If you **have an idea for an AIP that isn't written yet** (yes, there are
plenty!) check out [Contributing to the project][] to see how you can write
AIPs for others to follow.
